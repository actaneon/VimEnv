Match Pairs - %
% is used to match paired characters.
If the cursor is at a starting brace, pressing % will take cursor to the matching closing brace, and vice versa.
This works for () (parantheses), /**/ (block comments) etc.
This is handy, can be used extensively with other commands like d (cut), y (copy) etc.
If you need to delete an entire function block, place cursor at either one of the braces and d% will delete that full block.


Autocomplete
CTRL + n and CTRL + p will open the autocompletion box. You can use UP and DOWN to select one option and ENTER to use that word.
VIM searches the current file for matching completions. If you have tags then VIM will search the whole tags for matches


Keyword Program
SHIFT + k - if pressed within a word, it will execute a command (which can be specified), and passes the word as argument. 
Default is man. So, if you press SHIFT + k on a function, it will directly go to its man page, very useful during programming.

vEu		Switch word to lowercase
vE~		Modify word case
